## Introduction

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Prerequisites

- a UNIX-like system (see [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you are using Windows), in order to use the [Software Citadel CLI](https://docs.softwarecitadel.com/cli)
- a Software Citadel account, with a registered payment method (you can sign up [here](https://dashboard.softwarecitadel.com/auth/sign_up))
- [Python3](https://www.python.org) and installed on your machine

## Installing the CLI

```bash
curl -L https://cli.softwarecitadel.com/install.sh | sh
```

You can inspect the installation script [here](https://cli.softwarecitadel.com/install.sh) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/softwarecitadel/cli).

## Authenticating

```bash
citadel auth login
```

## Initializing the project

In the first place, we are going to install FastAPI dependencies. You can refer to the [official documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/#install-fastapi) for more information.

```bash
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn[standard]
```

Then, we can scaffold a new FastAPI project :

```bash
mkdir -p fastapi-testing/app && cd fastapi-testing && touch app/main.py
```

Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file, in order to install the dependencies in the Docker image :

```bash
touch requirements.txt
```

For this example, we are going to use the following dependencies :

```bash
# requirements.txt
fastapi>=0.68.0,<0.69.0
pydantic>=1.8.0,<2.0.0
uvicorn>=0.15.0,<0.16.0
```

In the `app/main.py` file, we can add the following code :

```bash
# app/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
  return {"Hello": "World"}
```

Now, we can initialize the `citadel.toml` configuration file, that allows to link the local codebase, to a Software Citadel application :

```bash
citadel init
```

This command will ask you to select/create a project and an associated application.

## Adding the Dockerfile

Let's add a Dockerfile so that Software Citadel can build a Docker image for your application.

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

We can fill it with the following Dockerfile (coming from [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/#dockerfile)) :

```bash
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /code

COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt

COPY ./app /code/app

CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
```

## Deploy the project

Software Citadel makes use of the `PORT` environment variable to determine which port to expose. We can set it with the following command :

```bash
citadel env set PORT=80
```

Then, we can deploy the application :

```bash
citadel deploy
```

Once the deployment is finished, type :

```bash
citadel open
```

to test your FastAPI application in your browser.
