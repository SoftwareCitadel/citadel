## Introduction

[Angular](https://angular.io) is an application-design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.

## Prerequisites

- a UNIX-like system (see [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you are using Windows), in order to use the [Software Citadel CLI](https://docs.softwarecitadel.com/cli)
- a Software Citadel account, with a registered payment method (you can sign up [here](https://dashboard.softwarecitadel.com/auth/sign_up))
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) installed on your machine

## Installing the Software Citadel CLI

```bash
curl -L https://cli.softwarecitadel.com/install.sh | sh
```

You can inspect the installation script [here](https://cli.softwarecitadel.com/install.sh) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/softwarecitadel/cli).

## Authenticating with the Software Citadel CLI

```bash
citadel auth login
```

## Installing the Angular CLI

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Initializing the project

Now, you can use the `ng` command to create a new Angular project :

```bash
ng new <my_angular_app> && cd <my_angular_app>
```

Now, we can initialize the `citadel.toml` configuration file, that allows to link the local codebase, to a Software Citadel application :

```bash
citadel init
```

This command will ask you to select/create a project and an associated application.

## Adding the Dockerfile

Letâ€™s add a Dockerfile so that Software Citadel can build a Docker image for your application.

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

We can fill it with the following :

```bash
# Use an official Node runtime as a base image
FROM node:20 as builder

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install Angular CLI globally
RUN npm install -g @angular/cli

# Install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Build the Angular application
RUN ng build --configuration=production --output-path=dist

# Use a lightweight base image for the final runtime
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the built Angular application from the builder stage to the nginx web root directory
COPY --from=builder /app/dist/* /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Expose port 80 for the nginx server
EXPOSE 80

# Start the nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

## Setting the PORT environment variable

We can set the `PORT` environment variable, so that the application listens on the correct port :

```bash
citadel env set PORT=80
```

## Deploy the project

Then, we can deploy the application :

```bash
citadel deploy
```

Once the deployment is finished, type :

```bash
citadel open
```

to see your Adonis application in your browser.
