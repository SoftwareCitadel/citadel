## Introduction

[Remix](https://remix.run) is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience. In this article, we are going to deploy a Remix application to Software Citadel.

## Prerequisites

- a UNIX-like system (see [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you are using Windows), in order to use the [Software Citadel CLI](https://docs.softwarecitadel.com/cli)
- a Software Citadel account, with a registered payment method (you can sign up [here](https://dashboard.softwarecitadel.com/auth/sign_up))
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) installed on your machine

## Installing the Software Citadel CLI

```bash
curl -L https://cli.softwarecitadel.com/install.sh | sh
```

You can inspect the installation script [here](https://cli.softwarecitadel.com/install.sh) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/softwarecitadel/cli).

## Authenticating

```bash
citadel auth login
```

## Initializing the project

We can scaffold a Remix application with the following command :

```bash
npx create-remix@latest
```

Then, change directory to the newly created application :

```bash
cd <app-name>
```

Now, we can initialize the `citadel.toml` configuration file, that allows to link the local codebase, to a Software Citadel application :

```bash
citadel init
```

This command will ask you to select/create a project and an associated application.

## Adding the Dockerfile

Let’s add a Dockerfile so that Software Citadel can build a Docker image for your application.

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

We can fill it this way :

```bash
# Adjust NODE_VERSION as desired
ARG NODE_VERSION=21.5.0
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-slim as base

# Remix app lives here
WORKDIR /app

# Set production environment
ENV NODE_ENV="production"

# Throw-away build stage to reduce size of final image
FROM base as build

# Install packages needed to build node modules
RUN apt-get update -qq && \
    apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y build-essential node-gyp pkg-config python-is-python3

# Install node modules
COPY --link package-lock.json package.json ./
RUN npm ci --include=dev

# Copy application code
COPY --link . .

# Build application
RUN npm run build

# Remove development dependencies
RUN npm prune --omit=dev

# Final stage for app image
FROM base

# Copy built application
COPY --from=build /app /app

# Start the server by default, this can be overwritten at runtime
EXPOSE 3000
CMD [ "npm", "run", "start" ]
```

## Adding the .dockerignore

Let’s add a .dockerignore so that Software Citadel so that it doesn’t send unnecessary files to the Docker build context.

```bash
touch .dockerignore
```

We can fill it this way :

```bash
node_modules
.git
```

## Deploy the project

To expose the application’s port, we need to set up the `PORT` environment variable :

```bash
citadel env set PORT=3000
```

Then, we can deploy the application :

```bash
citadel deploy
```

Once the deployment is finished, type :

```bash
citadel open
```

to see your Remix application in your browser.
